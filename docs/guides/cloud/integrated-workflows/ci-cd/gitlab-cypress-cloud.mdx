In the GitLab CI configuration we have defined in the previous section, we are
leveraging three useful features of
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud):

1. [Recording test results with the `--record` flag](https://on.cypress.io/how-do-i-record-runs)
   to [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud):

   - In-depth and shareable [test reports](/guides/cloud/runs).
   - Visibility into test failures via quick access to error messages, stack
     traces, screenshots, videos, and contextual details.
   - [Integrating testing with the merge-request process](/guides/cloud/integrations/gitlab)
     via
     [commit status guards](/guides/cloud/integrations/gitlab#Commit-statuses)
     and convenient
     [test report comments](/guides/cloud/integrations/gitlab#Merge-Request-comments).
   - [Detecting flaky tests](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management) and surfacing
     them via [Slack alerts](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management#Slack) or
     [GitLab PR status checks](/guides/cloud/integrations/gitlab).

2. [Parallelizing test runs](/guides/guides/parallelization) and optimizing
   their execution via
   [intelligent load-balancing](/guides/guides/parallelization#Balance-strategy)
   of test specs across CI machines with the `--parallel` flag.

3. Organizing and consolidating multiple `cypress run` calls by labeled groups
   into a single report within [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud). In
   the example above we use the `--group "UI - Chrome"` flag to organize all UI
   tests for the Chrome browser into a group labeled "UI - Chrome" in the
   [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) report.
