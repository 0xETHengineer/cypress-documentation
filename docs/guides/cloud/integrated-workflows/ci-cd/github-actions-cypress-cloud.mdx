In the GitHub Actions configuration, we have defined in the previous section, we
are leveraging three useful features of
[Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud):

1. [Recording test results with the `record: true` option](https://on.cypress.io/how-do-i-record-runs)
   to [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud):

   - In-depth and shareable [test reports](/guides/cloud/runs).
   - Visibility into test failures via quick access to error messages, stack
     traces, screenshots, videos, and contextual details.
   - [Integrating testing with the pull-request (PR) process](/guides/cloud/integrations/github)
     via
     [commit status check guards](/guides/cloud/integrations/github#Status-checks)
     and convenient
     [test report comments](/guides/cloud/integrations/github#Pull-request-comments).
   - [Detecting flaky tests](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management) and surfacing
     them via [Slack alerts](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management#Slack) or
     [GitHub PR status checks](/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management#GitHub).

2. [Parallelizing test runs](/guides/guides/parallelization) and optimizing
   their execution via
   [intelligent load-balancing](/guides/guides/parallelization#Balance-strategy)
   of test specs across CI machines with the `parallel: true` option.

3. Organizing and consolidating multiple `cypress run` calls by labeled groups
   into a single report within [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud). In
   the example above, we use the `group: "UI - Chrome"` option to organize all
   UI tests for the Chrome browser into a group labeled "UI - Chrome" in the
   [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) report.
